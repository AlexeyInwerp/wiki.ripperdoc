# Laptop Repair Wiki Project

This project is a draft for creating a comprehensive MacBook and PC laptop repair wiki, running on Hugo and generated as static HTML. The goal is to achieve close to zero hosting costs. The project is initiated by Alexey Lavrov and is highly inspired by the [logi.wiki](https://logi.wiki) website, where most of the articles were originally posted. Alexey will continue to post content on both [logi.wiki](https://logi.wiki) and [repair.wiki](https://repair.wiki).

In this project, the Hugo framework is used to generate the static site, ensuring fast load times and minimal hosting requirements.

## Editing the Wiki

To suggest edits or discuss commits, you need a GitHub account. This will allow you to contribute to the project by suggesting changes and participating in discussions.

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in the [Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

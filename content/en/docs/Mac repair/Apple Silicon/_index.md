Apple introduced M1 machines in the year 2020. Generally, the M1 platform has very few similarities with the classical PC Intel platform. However, since the T2 platform was somewhat of a bridge to Apple's own platform, there are lots of well-known parts from T2 circuits moved to the new platform (like Display/Backlight, SSD, trackpad and keyboard operation, battery charging controller, and many other things).

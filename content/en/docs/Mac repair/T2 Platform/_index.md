The T2(t8012) SoC is almost identical to the Apple A10 iPhone SoC, with several components such as the SSD subsystem being carried over. It interfaces with Intel processors using internal USB and PCI Express signal lines, as well as a few GPIO lines. Additionally, the T2 chip controls Intel power sequencing using scripts, and the Intel EFI is stored in a container and fed via the eSPI interface directly to the PCH.

The T2 platform is known for its advanced security features, including secure boot, encrypted storage, and hardware-accelerated encryption. These features ensure that the system is protected against unauthorized access and that data is securely stored. For us this means much harder Datarecovery. Ã¤#
